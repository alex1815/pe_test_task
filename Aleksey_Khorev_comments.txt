- My main specialization is React.
- In assets we have file with empty content. I'd ask what is it and can I remove this one or not.
- Changed structure - created another folder for components (or moved services from this folder to another one)
- The problim with requesting data twice - the problem in pipe - it was called twice, but I didn't catch the root of problem
- In some places we use ", in some '. I'd refactor this (I prefer user ")
- 6 Tests failed
- Didn't fixed pagination (it doesn't call the getting new data via resolver after navigation)
